### Settlement Threshold Testing
```python
async def test_settlement_threshold_trigger(self):
```
- **Creates virtual accounts** with configurable settlement thresholds
- **Simulates payments** that exceed the threshold
- **Triggers auto-settlement** via webhook processing
- **Verifies GAPS integration** is called automatically
- **Tracks settlement transaction records**

### GAPS Bulk Transfer Testing
```python
async def test_gaps_bulk_transfer_simulation(self):
```
- **Tests with multiple insurance companies** (up to 3)
- **Creates test settlement accounts** for each company
- **Simulates bulk transfers** of ₦100k, ₦200k, ₦300k
- **Calculates commission deductions** (1% platform fee)
- **Tests GAPS XML generation** and API calls
- **Provides mock responses** when GAPS credentials unavailable

## 🔄 End-to-End Flow Testing

### Complete Payment Flow
```python
async def test_end_to_end_payment_flow(self):
```

**Step 1: Bulk Payment Simulation**
- Multiple virtual accounts receive payments
- Squad Co simulation endpoints tested
- Webhook notifications verified

**Step 2: Settlement Threshold Trigger**
- Virtual accounts reach settlement thresholds
- Auto-settlement logic triggered
- Settlement service activated

**Step 3: GAPS Bulk Transfer**
- Multiple insurance company settlements
- Bulk transfer XML generation
- GAPS API integration tested

**Step 4: Commission Verification**
- InsureFlow commission (0.75%)
- Habari commission (0.25%)
- Net settlement calculations

## 📊 Enhanced Reporting

### Test Categories
- **Core Infrastructure**: Configuration, webhooks, virtual accounts, API connectivity
- **Payment Processing**: Single payments, bulk payments, settlement triggers
- **Integration & Settlement**: GAPS transfers, commissions, end-to-end flow

### Success Criteria
- **Core Infrastructure**: All tests must pass
- **Payment Processing**: At least one payment test must pass
- **Integration & Settlement**: At least one integration test must pass

## 🚀 Running the Tests

### Basic Test Run
```bash
cd /path/to/insureflow
