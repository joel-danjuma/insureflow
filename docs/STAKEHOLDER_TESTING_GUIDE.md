- **Settlement Automation**: Automatic transfers when thresholds are reached
- **Real-time Processing**: Immediate webhook processing and settlement triggers

### **For Technical Stakeholders**
- **API Integration**: Squad Co virtual accounts and payment simulation
- **Webhook Processing**: Real-time payment notifications and processing
- **GAPS Integration**: Bulk transfer capabilities to insurance company accounts
- **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and recovery mechanisms

### **For Compliance/Finance**
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction logging with timestamps
- **Commission Transparency**: Clear breakdown of all fees and distributions
- **Settlement Tracking**: Detailed records of all GAPS transfers
- **Threshold Management**: Configurable settlement thresholds per account

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues and Solutions**

#### **"No virtual accounts found"**
- **Solution**: Click "Create Virtual Account" first
- **Cause**: Testing requires at least one virtual account

#### **"Payment simulation failed"**
- **Solution**: Check that Squad Co sandbox credentials are configured
- **Cause**: API keys may be missing or incorrect

#### **"GAPS settlement failed"**
- **Solution**: This is expected in sandbox mode - GAPS provides mock responses
- **Cause**: GAPS credentials are for production, not sandbox testing

#### **"Settlement not triggered"**
- **Solution**: Use amounts above ₦50,000 or select "Settlement Flow" scenario
- **Cause**: Payment amount is below the settlement threshold
