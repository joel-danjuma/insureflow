# Database Population for VPS Deployment

## ✅ COMPLETED SETUP

Your VPS deployment now includes automatic database population with realistic sample data.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Deployment Script (`deploy-vps.sh`)
- Automatic database migration execution
- Sample data population after container health checks
- Comprehensive error handling and status reporting
- Sample login credentials display

### 2. Production Database Population (`scripts/populate_database.py`)
- **3 Insurance Companies** with realistic Nigerian details
- **8 Users Total**: 3 Admins + 5 Brokers  
- **50 Customer Users** with generated profiles
- **60-100 Policies** across all insurance types
- **Premium records** with various payment statuses
- **Payment tracking** with Squad Co integration fields
- **Broker performance metrics** and commission tracking

### 3. Local Testing Script (`scripts/test-populate.sh`)
- Test database population before VPS deployment
- Health checks and validation
- Container status verification

## VPS Deployment Process

When you run `./deploy-vps.sh` on your VPS:

1. ✅ Stop existing containers
2. ✅ Build and start new containers  
3. ✅ Wait for service health checks
4. ✅ Run database migrations
5. ✅ **NEW:** Populate database with sample data
6. ✅ Display login credentials and next steps

## Dashboard Benefits

Your dashboards will now show:

- **Real metrics** instead of empty states
- **Broker performance comparisons** with actual data
- **Payment status distributions** for realistic charts
- **Commission tracking** across different brokers
- **Policy portfolio** diversity across insurance types
- **Revenue analytics** with historical payment data

## Manual Commands

```bash
# Test locally before VPS deployment
./scripts/test-populate.sh

# Repopulate on VPS if needed
docker exec insureflow_backend python scripts/populate_database.py

# View deployment logs
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f

# Stop VPS services
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

## Ready for Frontend Development

With this data population:
- ✅ Insurance firm dashboards will show broker performance
- ✅ Broker dashboards will have client portfolios
- ✅ Payment workflows can be tested end-to-end
- ✅ Squad Co integration has sample payment data
- ✅ All user roles have realistic scenarios

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to VPS** using the updated script
2. **Test login** with sample credentials
3. **Continue frontend development** with Task #23 (Authentication UI)
4. **Verify dashboard metrics** display correctly
5. **Test payment workflows** with populated data
